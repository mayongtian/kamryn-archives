# kamryn-archives
## Description
Kamryn Archives is a HTML-based local character builder for the Kamryn Chronicles TTRPG. This is a Floorbread Forge project.

## Usage notes

### Actual Instructions
Open KamrynArchives.html. It will lead you to the right places. Don't mess with anything else.

### File-Handling
Because of JavaScript's bullshit issues in handling files, the file will always be downloaded to your default download folder. It can be selected again to load.
- that part of the code was lifted off of StackExchange so I'm honestly not sure how it reads the file, just that it works lol

## Architecture notes
### Tedious Data input

### TODO priority list
- make the HTML documents link properly
- make the passive effects work
- make the maths work
- make a python script that allows the races and subarchetypes to work
- do data entry
- get someone to bugcheck - im still not confident that files work the same way on windows computers ;-;
#### Future Updates
- make spells work
- make enchantments work
- make items work

## Data Entry Progress
- Spells are nonexistent
- The tank and warrior archetypes exist, nothing else
- the paladin subarchetype exists, and only until level 12
- the knight subarchetype exists till lv 1
- the frontline diver subarchetype exists till lv1
- equipment does not exist
- enchantments do not exist
- formatting is cringe

### Recruiting friends to help input missing Kamryn content into the file - I'll eventually write up a python script to aid with it

## Bugs
### File Handling
### Builder
- the class accordions are very very very bugged :||| - if i have bugtesters hopefully they can start to figure out why
- i think something is wrong with setLevel
- speaking of which changing the level does not change the number of ability points
- uploading a character only works half the time (?????)
### Viewer
### General
- None of the passive effects are ever applied, and a lot of them may be bugged.
